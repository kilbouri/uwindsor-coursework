Part 3: Explanation
	create_student allocates memory for an integer and a character pointer.
	Then, it measures the length of the passed string and allocates enough memory
	for it and the termination character. It copies the string into the allocated
	memory and sets the student's name pointer to the allocated string.

	change_name measures the length of the new name, allocates enough memory for it
	and its termination character, then, assuming it was successfully allocated, it
	copies the new name into the allocated memory, frees the pointer to the old name, 
	and updates the student to point to the new name.

	free_student frees the name pointer and then the whole student.

Part 3: Running Times
	create_student: O(1)* since no loops or reallocs are used (all ops are constant time)
	   change_name: O(1)* since no loops or reallocs are used (all ops are constant time)
	  free_student: O(1)* since no loops or reallocs are used (all ops are constant time)

	*assuming calloc() is also O(1).
